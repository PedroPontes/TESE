\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:int_outline}

\par In this work an introduction to the used concepts will be given. This will go through IR thermography, wettability and droplet impact physics and heat transfer phenomena. This introduction will be presented in Chapter 2.\\

\par In Chapter 3, the 2 conceived experimental setups will be explained. This will include explanation about the role of every material present in the setup and also the process of collecting data. The functioning of the IR Camera will be clarified aswell as the data collecting methods and software calibration options.\\

\par One of the most important parts of this work is the proposed calibration. In Chapter 4, the proposed calibration method will be explained and compared against the existing calibration. All the thought process behind the calibration and its construction will be shown. The data processing code that was made specially for this camera is also explained in this chapter and its effects shown.\\

\par The results of the experiments in various conditions will be presented in Chapter 5, along with the observed phenomena, making a bridge between the expected results, from the introductory chapter, and the obtained ones. The conclusions about these results and the used method will be discussed in Chapter 6 and clarified if the proposed objectives were reached. Also in this chapter, future work that will be developed around this method will be discussed.
