\subsection{Infrared Thermography Techniques}
\par Starting by its discovery, infrared radiation was first reported by Hershel's famous experiment with a prism that would decompose the solar light. Frederick William Hershel noticed that when he placed a thermometer outside the visible spectrum, its temperature would still increase and deducted the existence of invisible radiation. The first patent of a radiation based thermometer was emitted in the end of the 19th century \cite{DeWitt1988}. Only after World War II a single point laser thermometer used in medicine, started being commercialized. Thermal Cameras started being developed after the second World War, mainly for military purposes. A few years later IR systems would be used in various types of supersonic wind tunnels to detect aerodynamic heating. \\

%%% Czysz
\par In 1969 Czysz and Dixon proposed a thermographic method to gather quantitative results \cite{Dixon1969}. They applied a Phosphors coating to the surface. This coating is very sensitive to temperature. They placed heat sensors in key spots. The next step would be to use an Isodensitracer, a device that would read the density of the coating, make a density map (with iso-lines) and attribute a measured heat flux to each density level. They concluded stating that the key to gathering good quantitative results was to make a good calibration. \\
%%% Sargent 
\par Inspired by Czysz and Dixon's work, in 1998, Sargent \textit{et al.} took the same approach and decided to use IR camera to measure heat transfer in complex flows \cite{Sargent1998}. Their calibration consisted in placing several thermocouples in their target surface. This calibration is often called \textit{in situ} calibration, for being made in the measured body. After collecting the video tape from the camera and putting it in the computer they correlated the grey scale values of the image with the temperature measured by the sensors. The result can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sargent}. This figure also shows the fit curves, usually polynomials of second and third order. They concluded that IR Cameras had a lot of potential in fluid dynamics measurements. They also concluded that \textit{in situ } calibrations can be very useful as they eliminate the need to calculate emissivity. \\

%% Schwabe
\par In 2003, Schwabe \textit{et al.} pioneered the study of interfacial phenomena with an IR Camera \cite{schwabe2003oscillatory}. The experimented consisted on a cold surface where water would condensate, then flow back into a gap through a channel, where it would evaporate again. This was a closed cycle, covered by heated walls and a window made of Zinc Sulfide, a material transparent to IR radiation. To avoid condensation on the glass, a heater was placed on its center. This was a big obstruction to the camera's top view. \\

%%%Shen

\par In 2008, Shen \textit{et al.} studied simultameous droplet impact, and its influence on heat transfer from different heated surfaces \cite. The used technique consisted in placing a HS Camera horizontally to the droplet impact area and a camera bellow the studied surface. As different surfaces were tested, the nano-structured, contrary to the smooth ones, had a significant lower heat removal by the droplets. It was also observed that the spreading diameter would increase with heating for the nano-structured surface and evaporation time reduced.


%%Gerardi
\par In 2008, Gerardi \textit{et al.} started using thermographic cameras to study heat transfer in through the macro- and micro-layer boiling applications \cite{Gerardi2008}. They wanted to observe bubble formation and study heat transfer in the interface between the bubble and the heated surface. Bubble formation is a phenomena that occurs between a small time window. To achieve this a IR Camera with high temporal resolution was used alongside with a high speed camera. The bubble formation was observed from the bottom of the installation. This could only be done with a dichroic beamsplitter, that transmits IR radiation to the IR camera and is transparent to the visible light. To allow the radiation to pass from the bubble, the heated surface had to be transparent to both visible and infrared spectrums, so it was made of sapphire. The sapphire thin plate had also a deposited film so it could be heated with Joule effect. With this setup it was possible to observe heat removal from a bubble from a constant heat flux source as it departs, with elevated time precision. The fact that they were able to sync the frames of both the IR camera and the high speed camera enabled them to put side by side the images of both cameras. Correspondence of temperature maps and the phases of bubble departure was made so that thermal and physical phenomena could be matched. \\

%%Tartarini
\par In 2009, Tartarini \textit{et al.} crossed the study of droplet cooling with infrared thermography \cite{tartarini2009}. While previous studies focused mainly on stable isothermal conditions, Tartarini \textit{et al.} decided to focus on the study of transient conditions. To do this, the authors chose to use a IR transparent slab, heated by two radiators. Again, the IR camera would be put under the droplet, that would collect data, then processed in MATLAB to remove noise and apply an emissivity map. Tartarini \textit{et al.} coated the surface with a high emissivity paint on its upperside. The objective of this was to minimize errors concerning emissivity and study more accurately the solid-fluid interface. With this work it was possible to confirm a numerical model for transient temperatures. It was also possible to observe temperature drop at the center of the droplet using a time-frame of a minute. \\

%%Girard
\par In 2010, Girard \textit{et al.} used thermography in order to study droplet evaporation \cite{girard2010infrared}. This experiment, like the one Tartarini \textit{et al.} made, has an elevated time-frame, but has a more fine temporal resolution. In this setup a droplet falls on a heated copper surface. The IR camera was placed on top of the droplet on this setup. The authors observed the evaporation time using different surface temperatures. They focused on the interface between the water and copper that due to their different emissivity was pretty noticeable. They observed interface temperature and droplet radius along the time. \\

%% Kim and Buongiorno
\par In 2011, Kim and Buongiorno continued the work made in 2008 by Gerardi \textit{et al.} and used thermography to detect the triple interface between solid-liquid-vapour in pool boiling with a similar setup \cite{kim2011detection}. To detect this interface They used an optical silicon wafer (transparent to IR) in contrast with \cite{Gerardi2008} that used coated sapphire. The camera would detect the bubbles as dark spots and the liquid as bright spots. In this work the different absorptivity and temperatures of the distinct phases were used to detect the triple contact-line. They observed the formation of a microlayer, where the radiation from the vapor would cross the water, and an area where the radiation would come from the bubble. The fronteer between was concluded to be the limit between these 2 regions. \\

%% Duan
\par In 2013 Duan \textit{et al.} syncronized not only the high-speed (HS) camera with the IR camera, but also particle image velocimetry (PIV) data \cite{duan2013synchronized}. The objective was studying bubble formation and departure in pool boiling. The IR camera approach was similar to \cite{Gerardi2008} but the high speed camera was placed horizontaly to the boiling cell. All around the cell were glass windows wich enabled the side view. The PIV laser was placed in the window frontal to the high speed camera's window. They could observe a dependence of the interval between bubble departute and formation with temperature, a strong cooling underneath the bubble, due to the microlayer. The observation of micro scale phenomena was only possible only by combining HS, IR and PIV. \\

%% Sielaf

\par More recently (2014), Sielaf used a different technique to gather interface data from pool boiling \cite{sielaff2014experimental}. Sielaf used a thin stainless steel foil under a heater. Because the small thickness of the foil, the interface temperature on top of the foil would be very close to the bottom temperature. Sielaf also used a calibration technique close to the \textit{in situ} approach. With a thermocouple inside is pool boiling cell, near the foil, and with the very close assumption that the foil would be at the same temperature, each pixel was calibrated for that temperature. Additional noise filters were applied in the post processing. As many of the previously mentioned authors, Sielaf used the HS camera horizontally to his boiling cell. Another characteristic of his technique was that the foils  This enabled him to identify the transition from the contact line to a microlayer. Sielaf identified that this transition happens during the receding phase of the bubble. \\

%% Zupancic
\par Studies with the thin foil technique have been done during this and last year. For instance, in 2015 Zupancic \textit{et al.} used this technique while also applying different coatings to study different wettability regimes. In this study, the heating of the foil is made directly by Joule effect with copper contacts on the foil. In 2016 Petkovsek \textit{et al.} observed, with a similar setup the hot spot phenomena. In this hot spot, measured temperature would be higher than the surroundings. \\

\subsection{Numerical Studies}

\par In this section some relevant numerical work about heat transfer in droplet impact will e discussed. This work contributed aswell to better understanding droplet related phenomena and heat transfer.\\
\par Numerical droplet simulations have been done in the last century, but the assumptions made to simplify them were questioned by Healy \textit{et al.} in 2001 \cite{healy2001validity}. Heat transfer during the spreading phase had been neglected, for representing a small fraction of the evaporation time. Although it seems a reasonable assumption, Healy \textit{et al.} found that in the spreading phase, the droplet temperature raise caused an alteration of its properties which resulted in significant errors. Still in 2001, Pasandideh-Fard \textit{et al.} tested a numerical model that studied heat extraction, comparing it between impact velocities \cite{pasandideh2001cooling}. Besides validating the model, impact velocity had a weak effect on the calculated temperature variation and heat flux. The principal effect of the increase of this parameter is that more area is wetted which means that extracts heat from a greater area. Later in 2010, Strotos \textit{et al.} \cite{strotos2011non} was able to identify, in his numerical work, various phenomena such as the bubble trapping effect and the neck in the droplet's lamela, and the heat transfer effects that these phenomena cause. In the case of the bubble trapping effect, an increase of the temperature in the droplet center, in the first moments after the impact was noted. In the case of the lamela neck a relation was made between its formation and position and an increase of temperature in that area.
